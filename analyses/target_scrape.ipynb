    "Germany insolvency portal has no API access. Only way to get data is to scrape the web interface. The website uses java script so need to use selenium. The problem with selenium is that it is slow. Another problem with insolvency portal is that the search results dont contain address of the person/company in insolvency. Only way to get address is to click into detail page of each search result, where the address is present. Unfortunately address is not easily separable from other text. So Im not sure if insolvency portal of germany is even scrapeable."
