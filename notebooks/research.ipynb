The natural choice would be Slovakia, Germany, Poland, or Austria, as those are neighboring countries to Czechia. Int the country of our choice, there shouldnt be any geoscore yet, becouse that would make the thesis obsolete. The country should have some dataset with geographical locations (as buildings or at least voting districts), some data that could be used as target (insolvency rate, unemployment rate, etc.) and some data that could be used as features (voting results, population data, crime rate, etc.)."
